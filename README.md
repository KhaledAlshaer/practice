- [About](#About)

## Feature

    Functions as a standard compiler.

    Converts C code into machine code.

    Provides error and warning messages for debugging.

    Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols (tokens) such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

    Syntax Analysis: Constructs a parse tree from the tokenized input, verifying the correct syntax according to C language grammar.

    Code Generation: Converts the optimized parse tree into efficient assembly code, ready for assembly and linking to produce an executable.
